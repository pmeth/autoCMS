# autoCMS
Automatically create a CMS (Content Management System) using class names and data attributes in plain HTML/JavaScript/CSS site. PHP experience isn't needed, however, PHP is needed on the target server. Apache server with Mod Rewrite is also needed.

## Who Should Use This
This is for people who do not wish to use a complicated site management system like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or any other complicated system. This is for people who design simple HTML/Javascript/CSS sites and want to easily add a Content Management System without any hassle or learning a server side language and database system.

#### Please note: the master branch is in development!


### Steps
1. Create an HTML site and add the class "auto-edit" to heading tags, paragraph tags, span tags, or simply the whole div block.
2. Copy the admin folder into the root of your site
3. Make sure that the admin folder and sub-folders are writable
4. Visit http://yoursite.com/admin/
5. It will ask you to create a password, then scan your html files and ask you which ones to add to the CMS.
6. autoCMS will rename files to .php (scan for links and rename those as well) and add the appropriate php tags.
    * It will scan and look for edit tags and create a data file structure (JSON).
    * It will then bring you to a basic CMS to edit all your content.


## Tags Examples

#### Navigation Text Tags

```HTML
    <li><a href="..." class="auto-nav" autocms="home navigation">...</a>
```
**NOTE:**
* All auto-nav tags need as an autocms description attribute
* All navigation links that link to the same page and have the same text must have the same description


#### Text Tags

```HTML
<h1 class="auto-edit">...</h1>

<p class="auto-edit">...</p>

<div class="auto-edit">...</p>
```


#### Image Tags

```HTML
<img src="..." class="auto-edit-img" alt="...">
```
Or for background images **(Coming Soon)**

```HTML
<div class="auto-edit-bg-img">...</div>
```
**NOTE:**
* The bg-img will add a style attribute with a background-image: url(img/url/imagename.jpg); and remove any other style attribute. Add a custom class for all your other background image attributes and do not use a style tag with this autoCRM class.
* Image alt text will also be available to edit on non-background images.


#### Repeating Tags **(Coming Soon)**

```HTML
<div class="auto-repeat">
    <p class="auto-edit">...</p>
    <img src="..." class="auto-edit-img">
</div>
```

This would be the same as the following with as many iterations as setup in the CMS

```HTML
<div>
    <p class="auto-edit">...</p>
    <img src="..." class="auto-edit-img">
    <p class="auto-edit">...</p>
    <img src="..." class="auto-edit-img">
    ...
</div>
```


#### Blog/News Tags **(Coming Soon)**



### Data Attributes

##### autocms

This data tag can be used to add an additional description to a field, also used to know which navigation link is which.
